Why  are  we  not  working  on  laws  to  ban  gay  marriage  on  a  federal  level  and  let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  not  stop  there?  No  gay  adoptions  we  need  a  man  and  a  woman  in  these  kids  lives.  Regardless  of  what  liberal  propaganda  tells  us,  conservatives  out  number  liberals  3  to  1  why  do  you  think  fox  is  so  big  and  liberal  radio  shows  are  basically  non  existent.  Why  is  it  85%  of  Americans  were  against  Obama  care  and  yet  because  of  the  majority  in  congress  it  was  passed  anyway?  Conservatives  need  to  get  off  their  keesters.  In  Arizona  these  things  are  not  radical,  there  mellow.  Start  working  on  making  homosexuality  illegal  start  far  to  the  right  just  as  the  liberals  start  far  to  the  left  and  they  get  it  (Obama  care  etc.)  no  this  is  the  conservative\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  fault.  Gay  people  need  to  feel  shame  in  what  their  doing,  not  heroic  as  the  liberal  media  makes  them  sound.  Make  it  illegal  and  that  will  help  in  giving  them  the  shame  they  should  already  feel.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  just  not  right  it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  not  a  matter  of  hate  I  guess  I  hate  rapists  to  because  I  don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  feel  that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  right  either.\\nIf  we  glorified  rapists  and  made  them  sound  all  heroic  would  it  become  a  RIGHT  to  be  who  they  are?  That's  how  they  were  born.  They  didn't  choose  to  be  that  way  they  just  are  so  they  should  have  the  RIGHT  to  rape  any  man  woman  child  or  animal.  This  is  the  liberal  logic.  Next  their  going  to  want  to  pass  laws  that  being  a  rapist  is  just  sexual  orientation.  You  would  even  see  ignorant  people  trying  to  say  the  bible  says  its  ok.  If  it  were  ok  then  2  men  could  have  a  baby  without  help  from  any  women  and  2  women  could  have  a  child  without  using  any  sperm  from  a  man.

As  a  credentialed  and  educated  professional  in  my  field  it  has  become  quite  disturbing  to  work  with  the  environment  that  Service  Magic  has  created,  i.e.  a  false  sense  of  qualification  of  vendors  to  the  consumer.  I  have  spoken  with  many  arborists  from  other  firms  in  our  region  and  all  say  the  same  thing.  This  could  have  been  a  beneficial  service,  but  without  demanding  proper  insurance  and  credentials  from  its  vendors  it  simply  becomes  a  means  for  the  unlicensed  and  uninsured  vendors  to  gain  business  they  are  not  qualified  to  perform.  This  also  leaves  the  qualified  professionals,  such  as  myself,  without  a  fair  cost  comparison  to  offer  our  clients.  The  fact  of  the  matter  is,  companies  pay  tens  of  thousands  of  dollars  a  year  for  proper  insurance,  not  to  mention  the  cost  of  education  to  aquire  proper  credentials.  Service  Magic  comes  along  and  opens  up  an  outlet  for  those  who  have  not  performed  their  due  diligence  in  aquiring  these  necessary  benchmarks  to  practice  their  craft  to  be  solicited  to  the  masses  as  "qualified  vendors".  It\\'s  a  shame  and  has  become  a  menace  to  the  integrity  of  my  profession  and  those  of  us  who  have  worked  hard  and  payed  countless  dollars  to  make  ourselves  a  true  qualified  vendor.  My  hope  is  that  the  people  at  Service  Magic  make  immediate  change  in  their  qualification  of  vendors."

Electric  bills  up  300  dollars  a  year.  Average  age  of  an  American  owned  car  10  yrs.  I  can  go  on,  and  on.  This  POTUS  is  a  joke.  Look  at  his  past  voting  records  in  Illinois  and  in  the  US  Senate.  Consistantly  voting  present  or  abstaining.  He's  a  consumate  politician.

If  you  are  manager  of  this  team  you  need  to  be  strict.  Avram  Grant  was  too  soft.  Scolari  too  soft.  Ancelotti  in  his  2nd  year  too  soft.  Are  they  still  our  manager...  no.  By  time  we  have  a  manager  that  does  things  his  own  way  and  not  play  to  their  tune.  At  least  he  can  (if  he  is  sacked)  say  he  did  things  his  way,  unlike  the  other  scared  managers  afraid  to  touch  drogba,  anelka,  lampard  and  Terry.  Too  long  have  these  "big  personality"  players  rule  Chelsea.  Remember  in  the  3rd  season  of  Jose\\'s  reign  when  we  lost  the  league  to  untd,  early  that  season  Drogba  wanted  to  leave  as  he  was  sulking  most  of  the  champions  previous  2  years  and  after  Jose  left,  he  sulked  even  more  causing  lot  of  negativity  in  the  camp.  OH  and  remember  the  champs  final  the  sent  off  AND  ANELKA\\'S  MISSED  PENALTY?????  then  the  next  year  Scolari  became  manager  he  sulked  even  more  and  caused  again  negativity  in  the  team.  my  point  is  when  he  doesn\\'t  sulk  we  win  things.  Players  like  Drogba,  Malouda,  Anelka,  Lampard  and  Terry  get  paid  lots  of  money  per  week  to  be  professional  and  to  give  their  best.  CLEARLY  AND  THEIR  SHOULD  BE  NO  ARGUAMENTS  FROM  CHELSEA  SUPPORTERS  WHEN  I  SAY  NONE  OF  THESE  PLAYERS  THIS  YEAR  ARE  PERFORMING  WELL  ENOUGH  TO  BE  IN  1ST  TEAM  YET  THEY  ARE  DEMANDING  FIRST  TEAM  ACTION.  MALOUDA  IS  A  WAISTE  OF  TIME,  MONEY  AND  A  PLACE  IN  THE  TEAM.  If  this  was  Sir  Alex  instead  of  AVB  then  Man  untd  fans  would  have  supported  him,  i\\'m  asking,  can  we  not  do  the  same  with  AVB.  I\\'m  a  big  fan  of  Jose,  but  i  think  AVB  is  perfect  for  Chelsea  as  soon  as  the  older  players  leave  in  the  summer  we  will  see  the  true  CHELSEA..

Some  of  muppet  think  they  fought  their  Independence  against  the  UK,  morons  the  lot  of  them.  The  answer  is  simple,  if  we  were  the  leading  colonial  force,  you  would  be  an  ENGLISH  speaking  country,  you  aren't,  because  werent  it  was  Spain,  Portugal,  France,  our  interests  were  commercial.  Also  the  worst  part  is  they  themselves  exterminated  the  natives,  the  Spanish  started  it  but  actually  it  was  the  newly  formed  Argies  which  did  most  of  the  killing  of  the  native,  lovely  eh?  Clueless  stuff,  you  wonder  why  the  Government  gets  away  with  corruption,  so  many  ignorant  people  thats  why...you  shouldnt  judge  ALL  by  the  standard,  these  a  huge  amount  of  Argies  who  see  the  Cristina  drum  beating  for  what  it  is,  the  same  as  ALL  presidents  of  Argentina  do,  using  it  to  cover  their  failing."

Hayes\\nFebruary  20,  2012,  Vol.  17,  No.  22\\n\\nThroughout  the  2012  election  cycle  Republicans  have  pined  for  a  bold,  conservative  reformer\\xe2\\x80\\x94a  leader  courageous  enough  to  make  difficult  choices  and  articulate  enough  to  explain  them  to  a  skeptical  public.  The  good  news  is  they  have  such  a  candidate.  The  less  good  news:  Scott  Walker  isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  running  for  president.  He\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  running  to  hang  on  to  his  job  as  governor  of  Wisconsin.\\n\\nWalker  is  the  target  of  a  recall  effort  funded  by  national  labor  unions.  Why?  Reforms  he  made  to  balance  the  budget  have  dramatically  diminished  the  influence  of  public  employee  unions.  If  not  reversed,  these  reforms  will  inspire  similar  efforts  across  the  country,  and  the  outsized  power  of  public  sector  unions  will  finally  be  reined  in.\\n\\nThe  election  in  Wisconsin\\xe2\\x80\\x94which  will  happen  in  late  spring  or  summer\\xe2\\x80\\x94could  have  a  profound  impact  on  the  2012  presidential  race,  with  the  winning  side  emerging  from  the  battle  organized  and  energized  in  one  of  the  most  important  swing  states  this  November.\\n\\nWalker  came  to  office  in  the  Republican  wave  of  2010.  He  inherited  a  mess.  Under  his  profligate  predecessor,  Jim  Doyle,  state  government  had  operated  almost  as  a  slush  fund  for  public  employee  unions.  Giveaways  to  teachers  and  others  put  the  state  on  an  unsustainable  fiscal  path,  so  Doyle  raised  some  taxes  and  threatened  to  raise  others.  He  raided  a  state  fund  set  up  to  cover  medical  liability,  essentially  stealing  contributions  doctors  had  made  to  the  pooled  account.  The  Wisconsin  Supreme  Court  ruled  against  that  pilfering,  but  the  money  had  already  been  spent.  Even  after  budget  gimmickry  that  would  make  Fannie  and  Freddie  blush,  the  official  deficit  was  $3.6  billion.\\n\\nJust  over  a  year  later,  Walker  and  the  Republicans  in  the  state  legislature  have  nearly  eliminated  the  deficit.  For  the  two-year  budget  cycle,  the  state  will  show  a  $143  million  shortfall  because  the  stagnant  economy  has  resulted  in  lower  tax  receipts  than  had  been  projected.  But  the  shortfall  is  for  the  first  half  of  the  cycle;  Wisconsin  will  run  a  surplus  in  the  current  fiscal  year.  And  Walker  said  last  week  that  he  will  eliminate  the  remaining  shortfall  without  raising  taxes.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  a  credible  claim.  He  reduced  the  deficit  without  raising  taxes.  In  fact,  one  of  his  first  moves  upon  being  sworn  in  was  to  cut  taxes  on  businesses.  His  subsequent  reforms  have  allowed  property  tax  receipts  to  go  down  for  the  first  time  in  years\\xe2\\x80\\x94by  some  $47  million.\\n\\nThe  recall  vote  Walker  faces  comes  because  of  these  results.  The  key  to  his  success  was  his  restructuring  of  health  and  retirement  benefits  for  many  state  employees,  asking  them  to  contribute  5.8  percent  of  their  salary  to  their  pensions  (up  from  1  percent  or  less)  and  to  pay  12.6  percent  of  their  health  insurance  premiums  (up  from  6  percent  or  so).\\n\\nEven  some  of  the  governor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  harshest  critics  acknowledged  that  such  changes  were  reasonable.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWalker  is  right  about  one  thing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  wrote  Eugene  Robinson,  liberal  columnist  for  the  Washington  Post.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen  it  comes  to  pensions  and  benefits,  public  workers  in  Wisconsin  have  a  sweet  deal.  .\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xe2\\x80\\x89.\\xe2\\x80\\x89\\xe2\\x80\\x89.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  easy  to  see  why  the  average  private-sector  worker  in  Wisconsin\\xe2\\x80\\x94probably  paying  upward  of  25  percent  toward  health  insurance  costs  and  struggling  to  tuck  away  something,  anything  for  retirement\\xe2\\x80\\x94might  agree  with  Walker.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWalker  understood  from  his  years  as  Milwaukee  County  Executive  that  such  changes  could  not  occur  without  dramatic  reforms  of  collective  bargaining  for  public  employee  unions.  So  he  proposed  them,  and  Republicans  in  the  state  legislature  made  them  law.  The  reforms  also  ended  compulsory  union  membership.\\n\\nThe  unions  correctly  understood  these  changes  as  a  mortal  threat.  Without  compulsory  membership,  unions  would  lose  a  major  source  of  funds.  And  without  the  ability  to  bargain  collectively  for  benefits,  the  unions  would  lose  their  most  compelling  argument  to  convince  public  employees  to  contribute  a  chunk  of  their  income\\xe2\\x80\\x94in  many  cases  more  than  $1,000  per  year\\xe2\\x80\\x94for  the  privilege  of  membership.  So  they  took  to  the  streets  in  massive  numbers  and  pressured  the  Democrats  they\\xe2\\x80\\x99d  elected  to  do  everything  possible  to  sabotage  Walker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  plan.  Democrats  in  the  state  senate  fled  to  Illinois.  Protesters  occupied  the  state  capitol.  The  fight  captured  national  attention  for  months  in  2011.\\n\\nThe  unions  lost  that  battle,  but  they  did  not  give  up  the  war.  They  launched  an  aggressive  effort  to  recall  several  Republicans  in  the  state  senate  with  the  hope  of  reversing  the  reforms  before  it  became  clear  that  they  were  working.  They  spent  heavily\\xe2\\x80\\x94an  estimated  $30  million\\xe2\\x80\\x94and  lost  again.\\n\\nMeanwhile,  the  results  of  the  changes  began  coming  in.  In  Milwaukee,  the  reforms  saved  some  $11  million,  an  embarrassing  windfall  for  Democratic  mayor  Tom  Barrett,  who  had  predicted  that  the  city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  structural  deficit  would  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexplode.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Localities  across  the  state  have  seen  similar  savings.  There  is  no  disputing  the  central  fact  of  Walker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  tenure  as  governor:  His  reforms  are  working.\\n\\nThat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  a  huge  problem  for  the  public  employee  unions  as  they  try  to  convince  Wisconsinites  that  the  man  responsible  for  this  dramatic  turnaround  should  be  recalled.  So  they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re  focusing  on  two  other  issues:  his  2010  campaign  and  an  investigation  into  the  activities  of  former  Walker  employees.\\n\\nTheir  first  complaint  is  that  Walker  didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  campaign  on  the  specific  changes  he  would  make  to  collective  bargaining.  Walker  concedes  that  there  is  some  truth  to  the  claim.  He  wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  more  specific,  he  says  today,  because  he  did  not  yet  know  exactly  how  he  would  make  the  changes  to  collective  bargaining.  But  Walker  is  conceding  too  much.  He  didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  provide  a  point-by-point  proposal  to  restrict  collective  bargaining,  but  it  was  no  mystery  that  he\\xe2\\x80\\x99d  make  dramatic  changes.  Ryan  Murray,  a  top  policy  adviser  to  Walker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  2010  campaign,  made  that  clear  to  the  Milwaukee  Journal  Sentinel  in  describing  the  changes  to  public  employee  health  and  retirement  benefits.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe  way  the  proposal  would  work  is  we  would  take  the  choice  out  of  the  collective  bargaining  process,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  he  said  in  comments  published  on  August  29,  2010.\\n\\nDid  that  mean  an  end  to  collective  bargaining  over  benefits?  The  reporter  certainly  seemed  to  think  so.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[Murray]  said  school  districts  often  have  some  of  the  most  expensive  health  benefits  in  Wisconsin  and  could  receive  cheaper  insurance  through  the  state  if  they  didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  have  to  negotiate  with  unions  about  who  would  insure  their  members.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Christina  Brey,  a  spokesman  for  the  Wisconsin  Education  Association  Council,  the  leading  teachers\\xe2\\x80\\x99  union,  had  the  same  understanding.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOur  members  oppose  taking  away  their  rights  to  collective  bargaining,  so  they  would  definitely  raise  their  voices  against  it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Another  teachers\\xe2\\x80\\x99  union,  the  American  Federation  of  Teachers,  distributed  flyers  to  its  members  warning  that  Walker  would  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvoid  parts  of  labor  contracts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94something  that  couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  happen  without  changes  to  collective  bargaining  laws.\\n\\nIn  light  of  the  success  of  Walker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  reforms,  complaining  about  what  he  said  in  2010  seems  unlikely  to  win  many  votes.  So  Walker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  opponents  want  to  change  the  subject.  Last  week,  Mike  Tate,  chairman  of  the  Wisconsin  Democratic  party,  toured  the  state  in  an  attempt  to  link  Walker  more  closely  to  an  investigation  of  some  of  his  former  employees.  Here  again,  Democrats  have  resorted  to  distorting  reality  in  order  to  smear  Walker.\\n\\nThere  are  two  separate  issues.  In  the  first,  a  woman  who  worked  for  Walker  when  he  was  Milwaukee  County  executive  was  found  posting  political  comments  on  the  Milwaukee  Journal  Sentinel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  website  during  working  hours.  She  resigned  in  May  2010.\\n\\nThe  second  involves  two  former  Walker  employees  who  allegedly  stole  money  from  a  veterans\\xe2\\x80\\x99  organization  that  worked  with  the  county  on  an  event  held  at  the  Milwaukee  County  Zoo.  John  Chisholm,  Milwaukee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  district  attorney,  has  been  investigating  the  claims  for  20  months.  There  is  no  indication  Walker  knew  about  the  employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99  activities,  much  less  condoned  them.  Chisholm  has  said  that  Walker  is  not  a  target  of  the  investigation\\xe2\\x80\\x94which  only  exists  because  Walker  requested  it  when  he  was  presented  with  the  facts.\\n\\nSome  Wisconsin  Republicans,  pointing  out  that  Chisholm  is  a  Democrat  and  highlighting  the  steady  stream  of  leaks  coming  from  his  office,  are  growing  concerned  that  the  investigation  is  a  political  witch  hunt,  designed  to  bloody  the  governor  before  voters  cast  their  ballots.  Walker,  for  his  part,  says  that  he  believes  Chisholm  is  an  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearnest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  prosecutor  who  will  conduct  a  fair  investigation.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  probably  overly  generous.\\n\\nThe  coming  battle  for  Wisconsin  will  be  a  difficult  fight  for  Republicans.  Democrats  have  shown  that  they  are  willing  to  do  just  about  anything  to  win.  Unions  are  fighting  this  battle  as  if  their  very  existence  depends  on  a  victory\\xe2\\x80\\x94and  it  might.\\n\\nFor  conservatives,  the  fight  is  about  much  more  than  one  man  in  one  state.  A  Walker  defeat  would  send  a  message  that  political  courage  does  not  pay  and  political  thuggery  does.  Walker  doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  like  to  talk  about  the  effect  the  past  year  has  had  on  him  and  his  family,  but  it  hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  been  pleasant.  He  has  been  subjected  to  numerous  death  threats.  His  wife,  Tonette,  has  been  verbally  assaulted  more  times  than  she  can  count.  His  two  teenaged  boys  have  been  targeted  on  Facebook.  His  modest  home  in  Wauwatosa  has  been  the  site  of  several  union  protests.  Last  month,  a  protester  outside  Walker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  State  of  the  State  speech  told  State  Senator  John  Kleefisch  that  his  wife,  Lieutenant  Governor  Rebecca  Kleefisch,  is  a  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cf\\xe2\\x80\\x94ing  whore.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWalker  has  been  willing  to  endure  these  attacks  to  turn  his  state  around  and  defend  conservative  principles.  Conservatives  should  rally  behind  him.\\n"

0	"How  A  CSM  Works.  \n      After  a  hand  is  over  the  cards  just  used  are  placed  back  into  the  shuffler  to  be  mixed  with  the  other  cards  in  the  shoe.  Shuffle  Master\u2019s  King  uses  an  elevator  system  to  randomize  the  cards.  As  the  elevator  is  moved  up  and  down,  cards  are  randomly  inserted  into  one  of  the  19  shelves  in  the  elevator.  The  shuffler  randomly  selects  a  shelf  of  cards  to  deliver  into  the  shoe.  Because  of  the  non-linear  process,  every  discard  re-inserted  following  a  hand  has  a  chance  of  appearing  in  the  next  round.      Although  Shuffle  Master  says  The  King  differs  from  their  competitors  continuous  shufflers  because  the  others  use  a  linear  design  most  CSMs  so  the  same  thing.  They  put  the  discards  back  into  play  and  does  away  with  the  dealers  having  to  stop  to  physically  shuffle  the  cards  at  the  end  of  a  shoe.  \nThe  House  Edge        The  continuous  shufflers  have  no  benefits  for  the  player  and  has  been  dubbed  the  "uncomfortable  shoes".  It  eliminates  card  counting  for  the  skilled  player  and  will  also  have  a  major  disadvantage  for  the  basic  strategy  player.  It  speeds  up  the  game!  \nWhen  the  CSM  was  first  introduced  many  players  felt  it  would  probably  increase  the  house  edge.  As  it  turns  out  this  is  not  entirely  true.  Michael  Shackleford,  The  Wizard  of  Odds  did  a  mathematical  analysis  of  the  Continuous  Shuffling  Machines  and  found  that  there  was  a  very  slight  reduction  in  the  house  edge.  \nIn  a  four  deck  game  the  edge  is  0.034  percent  and  in  an  eight  deck  game  is  tis0.014  percent.  Before  you  get  excited  about  a  slight  reduction  in  the  house  edge  you  have  to  realize  that  when  the  casino  uses  a  CSM  the  speed  of  the  games  is  increased  by  about  20  percent.  The  basic  strategy  player  stands  to  lose  more  in  the  long  run  because  they  are  exposing  more  money  to  the  house  edge.  \nAs  a  player  I  feel  it\u2019s  a  treat  to  visit  a  casino  that  offers  double  and  single  deck  games.  I  would  hate  to  see  these  games  eliminated  altogether.  Even  a  multi  deck  shoe  game  is  preferable  to  the  Continuous  Shuffling  Machines.  The  best  way  you  can  let  the  casinos  know  this  is  by  refusing  to  play  Blackjack  at  the  casinos  that  use  a  CSM  for  their  Blackjack  games"

0	"From  what  I  can  see,  most  men  like  women  who  are  physically  fit.    You  don't  have  to  look  like  a  runway  model,  but  YOU  DO  need  to  look  like  you  take  care  of  yourself,  eat  reasonably  well,  and  exercise.    Studies  have  shown  (though  I'm  referencing  information  I  read  YEARS  ago)  that  WM  actually  prefer  a  larger  body  type  than  WW,  but  not  as  large  as  BM  or  HM.    WW  seem  to  want  to  be  a  size  zero,  while  WM  seem  to  like  the  athletic  Swedish  model  body.    Anyway,  I  think  both  of  the  ladies  above  look  very  attractive.    However,  I  don't  understand  this  fixation  on  having  butts  and  thighs  that  are  WAY  out  of  proportion  with  the  rest  of  one's  figure.    That  isn't  attractive  to  me,  personally.    I  just  don't  get  it.    And,  seeing  a  HUGE  rear  on  a  small  girl  just  doesn't  make  any  sense.    I  don't  know  how  it's  physically  possible  to  have  skinny  arms,  legs,  waist,  and  still  have  a  humongous  derriere  and/or  thighs.    Many  men  like  a  nice-sized  butt,  including  WM  and  AM  (I  know  from  experience),  so  a  BW's  full,  round  bottom  isn't  necessarily  a  problem  for  men  in  general.    But,  MOST  men  (including  BM)  don't  want  a  bottom  that's  so  obese  it  looks  like  it's  own  planet.    Get  and  stay  in  shape  for  your  own  health  and  opportunities,  BW."
