autoBOT API
===============
Many times model training is not the end goal of a given ML process. To address this issue with the current implementation of autoBOT, we implemented a simple-to-use API which gets automatically built around a given trained model `pickle`. Full API with the corresponding documentation is available as a separate project here: `autoBOT-api <https://gitlab.com/skblaz/autobot-api/>`_.
