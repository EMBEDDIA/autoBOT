Representation types are defined as follows (within autoBOT); the keys of these dictionaries are the arguments under the field `representation_type` (see `examples <https://github.com/SkBlaz/autobot/tree/master/examples>`_). Finally, note that new features are added on regular basis, hence there are more feature types available as in the original paper.

 .. code-block:: text

		 
    # Full stack
    feature_presets['neurosymbolic'] = [
	'concept_features', 'document_graph', 'neural_features_dbow',
	'neural_features_dm', 'relational_features_token', 'topic_features',
	'keyword_features', 'relational_features_char', 'char_features',
	'word_features', 'pos_features', 'contextual_features', 'relational_features_bigram'
    ]

    # This one is ~language agnostic
    feature_presets['neurosymbolic-lite'] = [
	'document_graph', 'neural_features_dbow', 'neural_features_dm',
	'topic_features', 'keyword_features', 'relational_features_char', 'relational_features_token','char_features', 'word_features', 'relational_features_bigram'
    ]

    # MLJ paper versions
    feature_presets['neurosymbolic-default'] = [
	'neural_features_dbow', 'neural_features_dm', 'keyword_features',
	'relational_features_char', 'char_features', 'word_features', "pos_features",
	'concept_features'
    ]

    feature_presets['neural'] = [
	'document_graph', 'neural_features_dbow', 'neural_features_dm'
    ]

    feature_presets['symbolic'] = [
	'concept_features', 'relational_features_token', 'topic_features',
	'keyword_features', 'relational_features_char', 'char_features',
	'word_features', 'pos_features', 'relational_features_bigram'
    ]



So, for example, to use the `symbolic` feature space only, one can simply:

.. code:: python3

    autoBOTLibObj = autoBOTLib.GAlearner(train_sequences,
    train_targets,
    time_constraint = 1,
    representation_type = "symbolic").evolve()
