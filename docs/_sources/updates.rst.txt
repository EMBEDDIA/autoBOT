Releases
===============
Please see the tagged versions of the code to inspect different releases of the library. As we remain actively exploring what's possible, the codebase could change (and defaults with it). Note however, that the *vMLJ* release was the one used for benchmarking.

1. 8.5.21 -> Changed the defaults so that multilingual settings work fine.
2. 11.5.21 -> Added document graph-based features (default configuration accessible as representation_type = "neurosymbolic-default")
