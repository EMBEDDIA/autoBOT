Scaling up (SLING)
===============
Being embarassingly parallel, individual evolutions can be sent to as many available machines as needed. To simplify this process, we constructed `autobot-cluster` a framework for generation and monitoring grid-scale meta learning, targeted at autoBOT. The project is available as `autoBOT-cluster <https://gitlab.com/skblaz/autobot-cluster/>`_.
